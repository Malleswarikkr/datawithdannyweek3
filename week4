1.How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system?
Ans:select count(distinct node_id) from data_bank.customer_nodes

2./*What is the number of nodes per region?
*/
Ans:select region_name,count(cn.node_id)  as count from data_bank.customer_nodes as cn join data_bank.regions
 as r on r.region_id=cn.region_id group by region_name
 
3./*How many customers are allocated to each region?*/
select region_name,count(distinct cn.customer_id)  as count from data_bank.customer_nodes as cn join data_bank.regions
 as r on r.region_id=cn.region_id group by region_name
 
4./*How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?
*/
Ans:select  avg(end_date-start_date) as days from data_bank.customer_nodes 
 where end_date!='9999-12-31' 
 
 5./*What is the median, 80th and 95th percentile for this same reallocation days metric for each region?
Ans:WITH a AS (
  SELECT cn.*, region_name, (end_date - start_date) as days
  FROM data_bank.customer_nodes AS cn
  JOIN data_bank.regions AS r ON r.region_id = cn.region_id
  WHERE end_date != '9999-12-31'
)
SELECT  region_name,
  MIN(CASE WHEN percentile_rank >= 0.5 THEN days END) AS 50th_percentile_date,
  MIN(CASE WHEN percentile_rank >= 0.8 THEN days END) AS 80th_percentile_date,
  MIN(CASE WHEN percentile_rank >= 0.9 THEN days END) AS 90th_percentile_date
FROM  (SELECT region_name, days,
      PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region_name ORDER BY days) AS percentile_rank
    FROM  a ) AS subquery GROUP BY region_name;
